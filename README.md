# Google News Scraper

Takes the headlines from Google news and can print them out. Also prints out the most common keywords. Not too useful right now but might improve in the future.

Sample output:

```
[('found', 8), ('.', 7), ('dead', 7), ('years', 6), ('Battlefield', 6), ('Reef', 6), ('Morrison', 6), ('Amazon', 5), ('Wizard', 5), ('elephants', 5), ('murder', 5), ('Typhoon', 5), ('slippers', 5), ('Jebi', 5), ('reward', 5), ('Labor', 5), ('Great', 5), ('Oz', 5), ('Trump', 5), ('Bali', 5)]
```

# Imageboard Scrapers

Ever wanted to archive or analyse the deep conversations on imageboards? Me either. But here's some code to do that. I have code for 4chan, 8chan and Lainchan. Might be useful for some kind of cyberpunk project in the future or something, idk.
